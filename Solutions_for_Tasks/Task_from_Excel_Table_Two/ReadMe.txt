Hello,
To find my dashboard for the data you provided for me you need to follow this website: https://egorsuslindatascience.shinyapps.io/demo/
This is the official website of the Shiny app of R markdown. As you said that I can use any tools, I chose this one, as it is the most comfortable for me.
Also in this dashboard I added new columns called Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 for question number two to show how did the total market shares of waters manufactured by Mattoni 1873 evolve in Q3 and Q4 2019
I can easily say that in Q3 total market shares of mattoni brand went a bit higher on 5-10% approx. and then went back on the same 5-10%.
But in Q2 and Q3 total value is approx. same. it is 13000 (in 1000000 CZK). Then in Q4 it went back to 10300 (in 1000000 CZK).
The Magnesia brand in Q3 and Q4 has 13000 (in 1000000 CZK), but in Q2 - 16000 (in 1000000 CZK).
So, as I see from this data, the value of the Mattoni company went down for 2% in Q3 and then went down to 22% in Q4. For Magnesia in Q3 : -16% , Q4 : -4%. 
Total Water market shares of Mattoni went down on 5-10% during Q3 and Q4, as I can see using provided data
